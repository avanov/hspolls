* Instructions for building

** Building the purescript frontend with pulp:

#+begin_src bash
pulp -w build --to static/app.js
#+end_src

** Starting an nginx server for development use:

We can build an nginx config file and get a bash executable starting
nginx with that config by first building the nginx nix expression
with:

#+begin_src
nix-build nginx.nix --argstr nginxRoot "$PWD"
#+end_src

then running the built executable with:

#+begin_src bash
./result/bin/nginx-run
#+end_src

The server is configured to listen on port ~8888~
